During the first few years of my undergraduate degree I followed
Giles Castel's note taking setup to a tee (you can find his tutorial [here](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/)). 

There's a singular end goal: writing text and mathematical formulas should be as fast as the lecturer writing on a blackboard: no delay is acceptable.

I never quite got the same speed as my lecturrers using LaTeX. 
The main challenges being
- I am a slow typer (~60 wpm),
- LaTeX has long compilation times (2-4 seconds) for a ~100 page document,
- LaTeX has convoluted syntax
