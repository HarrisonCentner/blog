title: The Order Reciprocity Theorem
modified: 2025-08-30
meta_description: "In the first half of this post I'll give some brief motivation for considering Omega-spectra that doesn't rely on many prerequisites, as something like a space but with both positive and negative homotopy groups. In the second part of the post I'll try to describe how we use the theory of model categories to understand spectra, and why we need to think about sequential spectra as well as Omega-spectra."
